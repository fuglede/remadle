# REMADLE

REMADLE is a port of the fantastic [COSTCODLE](https://costcodle.com) to Danish supermarket chain REMA 1000. Thanks to [@Kerm](https://github.com/KermWasTaken/) for building COSTCODLE, and for open sourcing its [source code](https://github.com/KermWasTaken/costcodle/) which we shamelessly ripped off.
